        <p>Traveling towards the bay along Maple Street you'll
        see the new jail on your right and the police
        station on your left and will then soon be forced to take a
        hard left turn.  The entrance to Docktown is on the right 
        about 100 yards further along.  Keep to the right and within
        100 feet you'll see the launch ramp on your right.  Find a
        place to park and then take the ramp down to the docks
        immediately to the left of the launch ramp.  You'll have to
        take a bit of a jog to the right to get to the ramp up to
        the deck and to the front door.

            <p>This is a floating home:<br />
            Access is via floating docks without railings.  Please be
            cautious.
            The water is cold and below it is thick soft mud.  Falling
            in will not add to the pleasure of your stay!  
            When on the floating home itself, please <b>do not</b> walk
            along the the perimeter deck where it is not protected by
            the railing.
            (There is a railing protecting access to the door.)</p>
